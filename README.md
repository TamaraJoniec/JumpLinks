# Jumplinks Component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build this handy jumplinks component that can be used to anchor users to specific sections in the page (see video for basic example of how it should function).

For the purpose of this exercise you are free to hard-code any data/html in the template and use *lorem ipsum* for content.

You **don't** need to pull in the content of any sections/jumplinks from any datasource/api.

The video shows minimal styling that we are happy for you to replicate, or feel free to improve on this styling.


## User Requirements

- Open the jump links navigation to see the set of links that they can 'jumplink' down to.
- On clicking those links it will anchor the page down to that section.
- The jumplink nav bar should stick to the top of the window when it reaches the top of the browser window
- The jumplink nav bar should unstick once it has reached the end of the jump-linkable sections (you can assume that the jump-linkable sections will always be grouped together).  You will see that there are sections above and below the jump-linkable sections.
- The 'active' section should appear in the jumplink nav bar as they scroll - assume this is when the section is in the middle of the viewport.
- The content inside the sections could be anything from text, images, etc (only text is shown in the demo video). So think about how the title would be associated with a section.
- The user is able to see some visual element that shows their progress through the jumplinkable sections area **(note: not the whole page)**.  So its at 0% when the top of the jump-linkable sections comes into view and 100% when the jump-linkable sections goes out of view (see blue bar in video).

## Tech stack requirements
- Javascript
- CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind CSS
- You are not allowed to use pre-made components - we want to see your own code.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries to help you e.g. GSAP for animation.

## Assessment criteria

- Nice Semantic HTML markup.
- Clean, documented, well structured code
- Consideration for accessibility  
- Smart use of CSS features
- Smart use of browser APIs

## Deploying your project

You can submit your test to a git repo along with any build steps to get the test running, or complete the task in an online editor e.g.  [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) or [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
Added bonus if you can deploy this somewhere publicly accessible e.g Netlify or Vercel 

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
